# Note

By some peculiarity in the TCC generation by PVS, the theorem `USER_LAST_TCC5`
in theory `gnsl_last` seems sometimes to have become a condition very similar
to `USER_LAST_TCC3` (and to which the same proof applies) and sometimes this 
seems to be subsumed by `USER_LAST_TCC3` and replaced by a condition involving
the minimum size of a list. It is the latter for which the proof is given.
